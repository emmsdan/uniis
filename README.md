# UNIIS

A folk of my own project to build something more simple and useable for me

I wanted to send a file I got online from A window PC to a linux, did not want to download something serious...

##### ALL I WANTED WAS, SELECT MY FILE AND SEND IT TO THE OTHER DEVICE, NOT SOME TECHNICAL STUFFS...

So, I folked my old repo, and made it simpler for me...
Please don't ask me why **_UNIIS_** because I don't know
